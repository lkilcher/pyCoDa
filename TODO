- Save to Matlab

Open questions:
- Should non-string keys be allowed? Pickle the key prior to writing?
- Make leading '_' entries hidden!?
- Should I drop the '_' attribute reference special case? Just make
  all attribute definitions that are not a key, *attributes*?!? This
  may not be necessary and may be risky as users use attribute and key
  reference interchangeably. However, I do need to document that there
  are TWO special uses of leading underscores:
  1) Hidden data entries, e.g.:
     dat['_a_hidden_item'] = 10
  2) Avoiding the dict
     dat._not_in_dict = 20
